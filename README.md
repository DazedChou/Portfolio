# Portfolio
# My-Portfolio

One paragraph of project description goes here.
For this project, I will create my own portfolio page where I can showcase my skills and talents to employers. I will be incorporating recently learned skills in order to design and effectively style my webpage. 

## Development

Knowing that I needed to have my name, photo, and links so sections about me, my work, and how to connect with me, it helped me layout my website and how I would structure it. So I simply began by creating a header and a nav bar with some simple styling at the top of the page and an image for the background.

Next, for the about me section, I added my image inline with a paragraph description about me.

For the section regarding my work, I decided to put a few of my major works onto a carousel in which the user can browse through.

And lastly, I made a simple section with my contact information and then centered it to finalize the website.
